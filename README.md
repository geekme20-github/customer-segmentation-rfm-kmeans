# Customer Segmentation: RFM Analysis & K-Means Clustering
## 📌 Project Overview.
This project develops an end-to-end customer segmentation engine using transactional retail data. By leveraging RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means Clustering, we transform raw transaction logs into actionable business personas.
The goal is to move away from "one-size-fits-all" marketing toward data-driven, personalized customer relationship management.
 
 ## 💼 Business Problem.
Treating all customers equally leads to inefficient marketing spend and missed revenue opportunities. This project addresses three core questions:
**Who are our most loyal customers?**
**Which customers are at risk of churning?**
**Which segments have the highest potential for upselling?**

## 🛠️ Methodology & Workflow1. 

# Data Processing & Cleaning
Using an Online Retail dataset, I performed rigorous cleaning:

**Validation**: Removed missing CustomerID records and cancelled transactions.
**Integrity**: Filtered out non-positive quantities and prices to ensure only valid purchases were modeled.

## 2. Feature Engineering (RFM)
I aggregated transaction-level data into three customer-level metrics:
**Recency ($R$)**: Days since the last purchase.
**Frequency ($F$)**: Total number of unique transactions.
**Monetary ($M$)**: Total revenue generated by the customer.

## 3. Data Transformation
To satisfy the assumptions of the K-Means algorithm:
**Log Transformation**: Applied log1p() to handle highly right-skewed distributions.
**Standardization**: Used StandardScaler to ensure all features exist on the same scale (Mean=0, SD=1).


## 4. Machine Learning Model
**Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering.
**Optimization**: The "Elbow Method" and "Silhouette Analysis" were used to determine the optimal number of clusters ($K=2$).**Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was utilized to visualize the high-dimensional clusters in a 2D space.

## 📊 Cluster Profiles & Insights
Loyal customers have LOW Recency + HIGH Frequency + HIGH Monetary. **Cluster 1**
Non Loyal customers have High Recency + LOW Frequency + Low Monetary value. **Cluster 0**

**Recommendations.**

**For loyal customers**, focus on retention and maximizing lifetime value. Implement a VIP loyalty program with exclusive discounts and early access to new products, which typically boosts retention by 20-30%. 
Offer personalized upsell recommendations for premium or complementary items based on their purchase history to increase average order value by 15%.
Create a referral rewards system where they earn £20 credit for each friend they refer. Send special birthday or anniversary offers to strengthen emotional connection.

**For non-loyal customers**, prioritize reactivation through win-back campaigns. 
Send time-sensitive emails like "We miss you! 20% off your next order - expires in 7 days" to drive 10-15% reactivation rates. Remind them about abandoned carts with added discounts to recover 5-8% of lost conversions.
Promote low-price entry offers on bestsellers to lower repurchase barriers.
Include survey incentives offering £10 off for feedback to understand why they've been inactive.
